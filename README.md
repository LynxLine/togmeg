## Usage
TogMeg is the application that simplify the learning process of new words by repeating them, forcing users to type in correct spelling and same time hearing correct pronunciation of new words. Also if you have installed voice for questions you make bindings of your native phonetic structures with learning languages. Some people prefer to hear only foreign language  words for better immersion – it just depends what is the best way you perceive information.

So to make the process effective you need to install voice engine into your system. If your target language is English than you already have high quality voice “Alex”. Also if your OS is Lion then you have access to about 24 languages-voices (Chinese, Arabic, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Thai, Turkish).

If you have old Mac OSX (less than Lion), then my recommendation is to have a look at Infovox iVox voices from AssistiveWare. They supply high-quality voices with price  about $99 per voice (maybe except Scandinavian voices, which are more expensive, not sure why). Anyway they provide ONE month demo that is enough for the effective usage in TogMeg for that period and understand if you would like to make such investment.
